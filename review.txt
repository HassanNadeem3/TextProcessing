**Code Review: TextProcessing**

**Documentation:**
The code does a solid job of adding inline comments to explain key sections like file reading and text processing. That’s helpful for navigation.
However, it could really use a short summary at the top of the file—something that outlines what the program does and how to use it. That context goes a long way for new readers or future maintainers.

**Error Handling:**
Good job checking if the file exists before attempting to read it. That proactive validation helps avoid common user mistakes.
That said, the code doesn’t account for other potential issues like file access permissions or IO errors. Wrapping the file read in a try-catch block would make the program more robust.

**Naming and Structure:**
Variable naming is clear and descriptive—`filePath`, `lines`, `wordCounts`, and `cleanedLine` all communicate their purpose well.
One downside: everything is still jammed into the `Main` method. Splitting the logic into smaller helper methods would improve modularity and make the code easier to read and maintain.

**Object-Oriented Design:**
Right now, the code isn’t really taking advantage of OOP. Encapsulating the word processing logic into its own class (or at least a set of static helper methods) would clean things up and pave the way for future enhancements.

**Program Logic and Output:**
Output is tidy, informative, and alphabetically sorted—which makes it easy to follow. Including a total count of unique words is a nice touch, and the labels are clear. Nothing confusing here.

**Suggestions:**

* Include a brief program summary at the top to explain its purpose and how it works.
* Add broader exception handling to cover unexpected file access errors.
* Break up the logic in `Main` by moving responsibilities into separate methods or a class.
* Keep up the good naming conventions and clean output style—it’s working well.
